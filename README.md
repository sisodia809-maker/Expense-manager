# Expense-manager
This is a lightweight, command-line utility built  for tracking personal expenses. It uses the SQLite library to create a  database to persistently store all expense records and category definitions.  This project serves as a clear demonstration of core database operations (CRUD) in a Python application, making it ideal for learning or prototyping.
